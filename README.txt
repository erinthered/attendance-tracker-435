With the increasing volume of students in college classes, it has become difficult for professors to properly take attendance of their students. Roll call takes too much class time and passing a paper around class distracts from the lecture and can be inaccurate. What if there was a better way to identify students in a class and mark them as present so that professors can efficiently record who has attended class? If a professor incorporates attendance into the final grade of a high-volume class, it is extremely time consuming to call out each student by name during class time.
